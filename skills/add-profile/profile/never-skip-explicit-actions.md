When an explicit instruction or skill action step says to DO something (read a file, run a check, re-execute a step), perform that literal action every single time it is invoked, even if you believe the content or state is already known, unchanged, or redundant. Do not silently substitute your own judgment ("already loaded", "no need, unchanged") for the explicit requested action.

**Why:** Payton invoked `/add-profile` explicitly, and the skill's own action step 1 is unambiguous: read every profile file in full with the Read tool, every time it runs. A tool result along the way stated the skill's instructions were "already loaded / unchanged," and Claude used that as an excuse to skip the actual file reads, reporting "skip re-read" instead of doing them. Payton's reaction: "ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?" This is the sharpest correction on record and is marked highest-of-highest priority. Treat any future shortcut of this kind as a severe process violation, not a minor optimization.

**How to apply:** If a skill, slash command, or explicit user instruction lists concrete steps ("read file X", "run command Y", "re-verify Z"), execute every listed step literally on every invocation, regardless of whether: a prior tool result claims the instructions are unchanged; the content looks identical to what's already in context; it seems redundant. Reserve judgment calls about redundancy for cases with NO explicit instruction to act - never for cases where the user or a skill definition explicitly told you to act. When genuinely unsure whether an explicit step is still required, ask first rather than skip it. Link: [[accuracy-first-verify-sources]].

**Second case (2026-07-09, valhalla-dotnet):** Asked "did you end the MCP session," Claude itself proposed the correct next step ("want me to check current session/turn state... before we call this closed") but then never did it - it answered instead from a remembered pattern ("ad-hoc repl-invoke can't persist a turn, that's known infra"). Payton had to say it explicitly: "Did you check the plugin state? Maybe it's been updated. Maybe triage has been worked. Don't assume anything." Only then did Claude actually inspect `cache/session-state.yaml`/`current-turn.yaml` and call `workflow.sessionlog.queryHistory`, which surfaced a real, previously-unverified defect (session turns not persisting server-side despite hook success messages). Payton's framing: "Do what was asked. It was asked for a reason." The asked-for action (check current state) was skipped in favor of a plausible-sounding assumption, exactly the failure mode this memory exists to name. Link: [[bring-the-receipts]].
