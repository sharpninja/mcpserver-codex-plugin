Session-log turn titles must be a concise SUMMARY of the user's request. Never the literal placeholder "User prompt", and not a verbatim first-line truncation of the prompt.

**Why:** Payton reviews the session log by turn title. "User prompt" and raw first-lines make turns unscannable and indistinguishable from each other.

**How to apply:** When opening, updating, or completing a session turn, set the title to a short request summary (e.g. "Reload+validate MCP plugin 1.26.0", "QuadBrain Creativity/Logic rename plan"). The plugin's `lib/plugin-hook.ps1` (L221-223) auto-titles from the prompt's first line and falls back to the literal "User prompt" on empty prompts (the Stop-hook continuation turns hit this). The deterministic hook cannot summarize, so the agent must refine the turn title. Never leave a turn titled "User prompt".
